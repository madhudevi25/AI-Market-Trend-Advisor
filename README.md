🚀 Enhanced Deployment Steps
STEP 1: Complete Enhanced Colab Pipeline
python# Add this to your existing Colab notebook after Part 2
print("🛡️ ADDING BIAS & FAIRNESS AUDITOR TO EXISTING PIPELINE...")

# 1. Add BiasAndFairnessAuditor class (provided in enhancement code)
# 2. Replace VertexAIMarketAdvisor with EnhancedVertexAIMarketAdvisor 
# 3. Test enhanced system with bias auditing

# Run this after your existing pipeline
enhanced_advisor = EnhancedVertexAIMarketAdvisor(processed_data, faiss_index, trends, competitors)

# Test with bias auditing
test_queries = [
    "What gaming trends should Nintendo focus on?",
    "How do our products compare to Sony's premium offerings?",
    "What demographic segments should we target for growth?"
]

for query in test_queries:
    print(f"\n🧪 Testing: {query}")
    result = enhanced_advisor.generate_audited_strategic_insights(query)
    print(f"   🛡️ Assessment: {result['responsible_ai_status']}")
    print(f"   📊 Transparency: {result['bias_audit']['transparency_score']:.1f}/10")

print("\n✅ Enhanced Colab pipeline complete!")
